## Description

The theme behind La Escuelita site focuses on presenting the practice of learning as a fun and interactive process.  Warm, thematic colors are spinkled throughout the site.  Along with rounded text and elements, these qualities help brand the daycare as a cozy, welcoming atmosphere for kids to kids.

Regarding UX, users enjoy a straight-forward layout, focued around a collapsed side navigation bar, with a submenu on hover, that beautifully covered the viewport with a gradient background.  On hover, the items in the navigation bar scale up and their container element adopts one of the thematic colors.   

This site's centerpoint may include the pages To-do List, Letters, and Games.  To-do List leads users (i.e., children) to a dynamic to-do list program that allows them to add, mark up, and delete items.  Letters showcases the letters of the English Alphabet as draggable HTML elements.  Lastly, hovering over Games reveals a submenu containing options for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division;
